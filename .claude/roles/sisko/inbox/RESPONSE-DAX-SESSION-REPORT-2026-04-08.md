# Dax Session Report — 2026-04-08

**From:** Dax (Architect)
**To:** Sisko (Product Manager)
**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Scope:** Bet 2 — Contributor-facing relay & dashboard + team infrastructure

---

## Summary

Single session. Three deliverables, twelve learnings, five future ideas captured, one downstream handoff dispatched. Total human-equivalent: 9.5 hours. Total wall-clock: ~45 minutes.

---

## Deliverable 1: Bet 2 Architecture

**File:** `docs/architecture/BET2-RELAY-DASHBOARD-ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Response artifact:** `roles/sisko/RESPONSE-BET2-ARCHITECTURE-FROM-DAX.md`
**Human-equivalent:** 7h (5h initial + 2h revisions)

Onboarded from scratch — read full codebase (Architecture v1, PRD v2, Capability Map, all contracts, watcher.js, server.js, KIRA.md, CLAUDE.md, all handoffs). Produced architecture document covering relay service, dashboard spec, migration path, repo topology, risk assessment.

Three revision cycles with Sisko. Key decisions resolved:

- **Evaluation model:** Relay invokes evaluation via `claude -p`, not Cowork cron. Eliminates notification spam and context window bloat. Kira's Cowork window becomes read-only on pipeline status.
- **Amendment loop:** Hard cap at 5 failed cycles, then Kira reassesses whether ACs still make sense given evidence from attempts.
- **No spikes:** Docker auth, cold evaluation quality, amendment convergence are standard engineering — handle during build, don't spike.
- **Four build slices:** B1–B4, no spikes, direct implementation. Kira slices when Sisko commissions.

## Deliverable 2: Idea-Capture Skill

**Skill:** `skills/idea-capture/SKILL.md`
**Central file:** `IDEAS.md` (repo root)
**Human-equivalent:** 2.5h (1.5h build + 1h eval)

Built a global team skill so every role captures future feature ideas inline during normal work. Two trigger layers:

1. **Inline** (best case) — role detects an idea and appends to IDEAS.md immediately
2. **Timesheet checkpoint** (safety net) — every time a role logs time, they scan the session for missed ideas

Wired into team infrastructure:
- TEAM-STANDARDS.md updated — new standard #2 (Idea Capture), renumbered existing standards to 3–5
- Estimate-hours skill updated with checkpoint instruction

**Eval results:** Ran 3 test scenarios (Kira reviewing DONE report, Dax mid-architecture, O'Brien mid-implementation), each with-skill and without-skill baseline. With-skill: 15/15 assertions passed. Without-skill: 9/15. Baselines captured ideas but in freeform formats with priority labels and verbose structure. The skill enforces consistent format, no priority assignment, and concise entries — at zero additional token cost.

Eval viewer generated at `skills/idea-capture-workspace/eval-viewer.html`.

## Deliverable 3: Ziyal Handoff — Internal Improvement Features

**Handoff:** `roles/ziyal/HANDOFF-INTERNAL-IMPROVEMENT-FEATURES-FROM-DAX.md`
**Response artifact:** `roles/sisko/RESPONSE-INTERNAL-IMPROVEMENT-FEATURES-FROM-DAX.md`

Per Sisko's request, briefed Ziyal on designing a minor feature section promoting five internal improvement capabilities:

1. Economics tracking (human-hours + token cost per deliverable)
2. Idea capture (inline + checkpoint, central backlog)
3. Continuous learning (per-role LEARNING.md, cross-project persistence)
4. Debrief and review (project observations staged for triage)
5. Cross-project role memory (learnings compound across projects)

Framing guidance: understated, not hype. Minor section, not the hero story.

## Ideas Captured (IDEAS.md)

Three entries seeded during this session:

1. **Quark: Automated economics and efficiency tracker** — dedicated role that watches the repo, tracks time/cost, computes efficiency metrics, devises improvement ideas
2. **Team chat room for multi-role alignment** — shared channel for multi-party alignment instead of bouncing artifacts
3. **Idea-capture reliability tracking** — mechanism to audit whether the skill fires reliably (diff IDEAS.md against transcripts)

---

## Learnings Captured (LEARNING.md)

Twelve entries, grouped into three categories:

- **Lovable frontend constraints** (1–5): one-directional repo integration, CSR-only React, SEO requires Cloudflare Pages, prerendering blocker, plan repo topology around Lovable
- **Architectural decision patterns** (6–8): wrap before replace, spike feasibility before designing, disposable prototypes OK
- **Risk communication discipline** (9–12): classify risks by severity, don't spike standard engineering, stay in lane on handoffs/sequencing, log time automatically
