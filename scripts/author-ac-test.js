// author-ac-test.js — Julian's (Bashir's) USER-GUIDED test authoring.
//
// This is the auto-WRITE half of the test-update gate: given an acceptance criterion that
// the CHECK gate flagged (new + uncovered, or changed + conflicting with an existing test),
// spawn a Bashir agent (claude -p) to AUTHOR or UPDATE the test that guards it — writing a
// DRAFT for human review, never straight into the live suite.
//
// User-guided by design: the agent is instructed that when the right user JOURNEY (what to
// assert / which path to cover) is genuinely ambiguous, it must NOT guess — it writes a
// short, specific QUESTION for the operator and stops. The operator answers, then re-runs
// with --journey "<answer>" to produce the test. This keeps the human on exactly the
// high-judgment decision and the agent on the mechanical authoring — which is the safe
// division (an agent silently rewriting assertions to "match" an AC could mask a real
// regression; a human-confirmed journey can't).
//
// APPLICABLE BY CONSTRUCTION (slice 357): a draft is only written when it carries what the
// coverage deriver needs to COUNT it — the `@ac-hash` annotation with the spec's own hash,
// the tag in a test() title, a runnable extension, and a companion declaring where it lands.
// Without those a draft can be applied, run, pass, and register NO coverage: the AC stays
// flagged and the only control left is "No test needed for this AC" — a well-meant apply
// that silently weakens the suite. The contract lives in lib/draft-contract.js; here it is
// (a) instructed to the agent with the exact hash precomputed, and (b) VERIFIED afterwards.
// A draft that fails verification is not left behind as a draft.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/author-ac-test.js <slice-N-ac-K> [--text "<AC text>"] [--journey "<operator answer>"]
//
// Output (in regression/.drafts/):
//   <tag>.draft.test.js   — proposed node:test guard (lands under regression/<area>/)
//   <tag>.draft.spec.js   — proposed Playwright guard (lands under e2e/)
//   <tag>.target.json     — {"new": "<path>"} or {"replaces": "<path>"} — where it lands
//   <tag>.rationale.txt   — one-line why
//   <tag>.QUESTION.md     — present ONLY when the agent needs a journey decision from you
//   <tag>.REJECTED.md     — present when the agent's draft broke the contract (with reasons)

Make the call that best surfaces faults, write one line of WHAT you decided and WHY into the rationale, and proceed. Escalate (write ${DRAFT_DIR}/${tag}.QUESTION.md and STOP) ONLY for a genuine PRODUCT-level ambiguity unresolvable from the AC text + the codebase — e.g. the AC contradicts itself, or the correct behaviour depends on intent only the product owner holds. Default strongly to deciding.`;

const prompt = `You are Julian (Bashir), the QA engineer for this repo. Your mission is ADVERSARIAL: surface as many wrong/faulty things as fast as possible — you write tests to BREAK the feature, never to rubber-stamp it. You did NOT build this code; your incentive is to catch its faults, which is exactly why it is safe for you (not the implementer) to author the guard. The test-update gate flagged an acceptance criterion that needs coverage. Author (or update) the test that GUARDS it.

AC ${tag}: ${acText || '(text not found in trailers/manifest — infer the intent from the codebase and the tag)'}

Steps:
1. Explore the repo. Find the feature/behaviour this AC describes (dashboard/, lib/, scripts/, server) and any EXISTING tests (regression/**/*.test.js node:test, e2e/*.spec.js Playwright) that touch it. Match the house style and the j-<name> ${tag} naming.
2. If an existing test CONFLICTS with this AC (a wanted change), UPDATE it to match — preserving its real intent, never weakening it to a no-op just to pass.
3. If nothing covers this AC, WRITE a new test. node:test for source/logic assertions; Playwright (e2e/) for browser journeys.
4. ${journeyClause}
5. Otherwise write your proposed test to ${DRAFT_DIR}/${tag}.draft.<ext> and a one-line rationale to ${DRAFT_DIR}/${tag}.rationale.txt.

THE DRAFT CONTRACT — a draft that breaks any of these is REJECTED and thrown away, because the coverage deriver would not count it: applied, it would run, pass, and leave ${tag} still flagged.

A. ANNOTATION. The draft MUST contain this line, verbatim, near the top (copy it exactly — do not recompute the hash, do not shorten it):
${ANNOTATION}
B. TAGGED TITLE. At least one test() title must contain the literal ${tag} (e.g. test('J-<name> ${tag} — …', …)). The deriver only registers the annotation alongside a tagged title; an annotation on its own registers nothing.
C. EXTENSION. Exactly one of:
   ${DRAFT_DIR}/${tag}.draft.test.js   → a node:test guard, landing under regression/<area>/
   ${DRAFT_DIR}/${tag}.draft.spec.js   → a Playwright guard, landing under e2e/
   No other extension exists. A bare .js draft is picked up by neither \`node --test 'regression/**/*.test.js'\` nor the coverage walker — it would be invisible to both, forever.
D. DECLARED TARGET. Also write ${DRAFT_DIR}/${targetName(tag)} — a JSON object with EXACTLY ONE of:
   {"tag": "${tag}", "new": "regression/<area>/j-<name>.test.js"}        — a brand-new guard at a path that does NOT yet exist
   {"tag": "${tag}", "replaces": "e2e/<existing>.spec.js"}               — you rewrote an EXISTING guard; applying overwrites that file
   If step 2 applied (you updated an existing test), it is ALWAYS "replaces" naming that exact file. Getting this wrong means both copies land and both register, inflating the guard count and forcing a Coverage-Removed: trailer later just to delete the duplicate. The path's extension and directory must match the draft's (.test.js → regression/, .spec.js → e2e/).

HARD RULES: this is a DRAFT for human review — do NOT modify, add, or delete anything in the live regression/ or e2e/ suites, or anywhere outside ${DRAFT_DIR}. The draft must be runnable and must genuinely fail if the AC is violated.`;
