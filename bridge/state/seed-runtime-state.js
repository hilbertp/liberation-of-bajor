/**
 * seed-runtime-state.js — slice 372
 *
 * The volatile runtime state (heartbeat ticks, queue ordering, branch topology,
 * timesheets, trash bookkeeping) is deliberately NOT tracked by git: while it was
 * tracked the working tree was permanently dirty, so the orchestrator's defensive
 * pre-checkout autocommit swept machine bookkeeping into a commit on the
 * integration branch on every single slice run.
 *
 * Untracking it means nothing in a fresh clone recreates these files, and several
 * of them are read before they are first written (branch-state.json in particular
 * has a schema the dashboard and the gate both parse). So every entry point seeds
 * them instead: ensureRuntimeState() creates any that are missing, with a valid
 * empty-but-well-formed body, and never touches one that already exists.
 *
 * ── Restoring, not just seeding ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Untracking has one sharp edge, and it is not at `git rm --cached` time: it is at
 * MERGE time. `--cached` spares this worktree, but the deletion is real in the
 * commit, so whoever merges the branch has the files removed from THEIR working
 * tree — and that worktree is the live pipeline. Most of these files are cheap to
 * lose (the next tick rewrites them); the append-only ledgers are not. The
 * timesheet is the project's whole economics record and `rebuildMerged()` in
 * slicelog.js reconstructs it by reading `timesheet-*.jsonl` off disk — which this
 * slice untracks too. Seeding `''` over that gap turns "missing" into "empty",
 * which reads as truth and is not.
 *
 * So a file that is absent from disk but still reachable in git history is
 * RESTORED from history first, and only falls back to the empty body when history
 * has nothing. Heartbeat is the one deliberate exception: a restored `ts` would
 * read as a live orchestrator to every liveness check in the system, and a
 * heartbeat is worth exactly one 60-second tick. It is always seeded, never
 * restored.
 *
 * ── Slice 381 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Slice 372 shrank the autocommits but did not stop them: it missed
 * regression/AC-DECISIONS.json, the CHECK overlay's ledger of the operator's
 * per-AC rulings, which is rewritten during normal operation exactly like the
 * files above. It joins the list here rather than getting a rule of its own, so
 * the ignore file, the seeder and the autocommit filter keep reading from one
 * place.
 *
 * Idempotent. Safe to call on every startup, from tests, and from the CLI:
 *
 *   node bridge/state/seed-runtime-state.js
